# What is the decision?
Today I made I decision: I decided to not posting image on blog.

# Why I made it?
Why I suddenly decided to do so? There are several reasons. First reason is that adding images make my life harder. Third is because recording my thoughts in English only improve the writing skill.

# How did importing images take my time?
Before I stating how it make my life harder, I must introduce how fussy posting an images on website is:

Firstly, I need to take a picture with corresponding topic, then export it from my mobile to laptop with airdrop. Secondly I need to create a folder in this blog project for storing images, then rename the file and take it inside.

Those process literally significantly reduced the motivation for me to blog.

# How not posting image can improve writing?
The first reason why writing only is because adding images on the website, make the actual content not important. The second reason is because this

Why it make actual content not invisible? Well, it is simply because images attract more attensions. While people read, images always catch the very first attension with its colorful content. 

However, combination of colors stimualtes more than word. As a result, people get more pleasure when they broswing images, how do they focus on the actual content coming next?

# Conclusion
In conclusion, as adding images make writng jorney harder, and it makes actual content invisible, the images will be removed since no on. Even some day I will re-consider to embed images in the content, but hardly with blog.
