Today I quited the part-time job at Naxeion Cafe. Let's talk about why, and how I feel.

The reason why I quit is because this is a job pays very a little, only 18 dollors per hours. The second reason is that I have English speaking club to attend, and I think it worths more. Third is that I am not going to do the barista in the future, what I am going to be is software engineer in the backend. So why should I do the job has no return and not makes me feel good about?

So I decided to quit.

After quiting, I feel excieted and was worrying about how Connie would reply to me. What suprise me is that she said "Take it easy, work hard on studying, come have a cup of coffee when you feel free." After she saying that, I felt I made a bad decision for a while.

Anyway, I've decided to leave. And I will move forward.

All the best to Connie and Tony, and people I met in Naxeion cafe. To Carrol and her beloved puppy.
