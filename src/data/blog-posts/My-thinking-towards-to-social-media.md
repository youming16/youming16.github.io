# What happend to me?

Well, today I've been wasting hours on browsing social medias for nothing, watching no-brain staff to make me laugh. However, I was unable to concentrate on learning at all, and can't help thinking about the funny staff I haven't watch. What come to the next? I spent 5 hours just for a 2 hours online tutorial in the morning. Obviously, my brain has been boiled with them. In the afternoon, I was sitting in front of the desk table and did nothing. In order to aviod this situation happen again, I try to figure out the why social media blow my mind out of the control.

# How do I feel when I watch them

The frist quesion came to me: Why do I watch social media? Probobaly because I feel boring, I wanna get something makes me happy. But here we have another question come after: do I feel happy when I do so?

My answer is I don't know, because I was not able to observe my emotion as social media has took all of the attention. For example, when I was watching an Youtuber channel called "Leya蕾雅", I always lose all my attention to myself. Here is coming with a question: What makes her video so charming to me? And why I can't feel what I feel when I watching her videos? To find out the reason, let me introduce her channel first. Her channel audience is those game lovers. In her videos, she spend hours to introduce game background and classic stories, for attracting new players come in. For example, her series of "The withcher", she made 4 videos (total 5 hours approx) to state how fasinating the world in "Witcher" is. Every time I finished one part, I can't stop myself to find out more come next to the main character, and keep exciting about ending.

# The difference between social media and book

However, every time I finish watching her video, I can't outline the stories she talked about few minutes ago or recall what I feel (or learn) from the stories. It is a completely different feeling with reading book. As for reading, I can remember the stories in the book I read 6 months ago, or some feelling about tiny details hiding in the book.

I guess it is because while I read book, I focus on my inner feeling. But for watching Youtube videos, I focus on somethings else. (probobaly focus on nothing). Even though Laya is my favorite Youtuber, her video is somewhat meaningful, also probobaly has most interesting staff among all the channel I followed.

# Conclusion: Should I quit it?

Well, The answer is still depends. But up to right now, you probobaly already have the answer in your heart.

If you would like to do so, good, you may start just for not installing Youtube on your mobile phone at first. People are not been able to shift their habits so suddenly, as our brain can only adapt some tiny changes every single day as it will make us feel uncomfortable. However, making things easier is helpful for quiting old habits and forming new ones. According to the reseach towards to Fogg behaviour model (Lawly, 2013) reveals that in order for a person to conduct a target action, he or she must be (1) adequately motivated, (2) capable of performing the activity, and (3) triggered to perform the behaviour. Motivation and capability are the things we unable to control with, however, we can make the trigger to the behavior more obviously if we like to form a new behavioral pattern. For example, if I wanna sleep before 10:30 p.m., instead of forcing myself to sleep, I would rather giving myself a hint of lying on the bed at 9:00 p.m. Sending hint actually helped me to stop doing something.

If you wouldn't, that's ok. As browsing social media is part of modern life already. Videos and images are also an important way to deliver thoughts or record life. We hardly live without social media nowdays especially for younger generation like you and me. for example, I leave my country and came to Australia for studying at end of 2019, and I can hardly go back until one month ago. In this situation, if without social media, how could I contact with my parents and old friends? Or with letter? I can't see it work for me. If you have highly self-awareness, stop youself browsing at any time you want, sociam media won't be harmful to you. Otherwise, quiting it might be benefical.
