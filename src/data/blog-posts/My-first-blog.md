# Sailing to the future

Hi

This letter recorded the reason you started writing, and decided to post them online.

Well, I used to write journey and keep my ideas on the paper,  but I think I haven't get used to write something with laptop. When I typing words with keyboard, it has totally different feeling.

Why I start writing blog? Simple because *I wanna get known more about myself.* Hope someday I can come back here, and still remember what I was thinking about.

Keep that in mind, you don't have to write cool stall on this website, as long as you keep writing, even simply write something about you feelings right now

# What I am doing these days?

## The feeling of today

In today's dinner with Helen, Huseyin and Kueng, we had some potatos and some vegs. We talked about whether, we talk about what we did, just as usual. I feel happy about that, and I started to wait for everyday's dinner, just for having a chat with them. I think I am a person who enjoying communication

## The book I read

It's called *How to master emotion.* For now it's up to chapter 2, and in chapter 1, author states the benefit of getting know about what emotion is, and how it affect our productivity and happiness. 

By the way, I would like to keep down the thoughts about last book I read a week ago, it is a book about learning how to learn. What made me astonished is that, always keep you feeling good about something, it is the most important thing. As if you feel good about doing something, you stick with it. Such as I only solve one leetcode problem everyday, this habit almost can be insisted in any circumstance, even the day before final examination (I suppose). As long as I can stick to something, someday I will just learn massive thing from it. May someday I suddenly found out the massive benefit of learning DSA...

## What I learn today?

Recent days I've been working on learning how to build website. Follow the course on udemy, I like that Japanese tutor, her accent, her patients, her humor. I think it is a good start for me to learn online with her.

# End

Just keeping writing as a flow, this made me feel good.

All the best
